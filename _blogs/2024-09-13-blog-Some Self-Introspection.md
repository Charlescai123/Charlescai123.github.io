Title: Self-Introspection

===

I used to think the PhD are for those smart guys. Who is not smart doesn't deserve a PhD. It seems I'm wrong. It's not only about IQ, but it's all about the details in your daily life and the way you're dealing with the problem you're facing. I used to be eager for the achievement like publishing a paper at an early stage and think the more you devote to it the fast and large achievement you'll obtain. It seems not like this at all. There're several problems I have when exposed to the research:

1. Too eager to finish something that I ignore the objective facts that exist during the process. You have to make things step by step instead of doing all of it at once. Make it happen and allow whatever will come. This stands out especially for the complex system. Make the logictics pretty clear and do it one by one. Never expect you could do all the things at once without making any mistake. 

2. Good arrangement for your working and lifestyle. I used to think PhDs have no life and breaks but it seems not like this. I think PhDs should spend a lot of time on research or otherwise he or she may be ineligible. I was wrong because PhDs are highly flexible and self-independent.

3. Stick to the plan and pick the key points. I'm a perfectionism who wants to complete and achieve all the things on my own at once. While the PhDs should have their focus and should allow there're something that they don't actually know well about or cannot do well. For example, I was eager to optimize the code like making everything modular and easy for other's to use. The existing objective is that what we should focus is to validate our theory on the platform instead of focusing on the platform itself. There're many people from industries can help do this as long as it is opensource. Don't make effort in doing the things irrelevant to your research even if you're good at it.
